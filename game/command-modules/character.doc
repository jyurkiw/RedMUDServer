What makes a character?

A character is a collection of data, owned by a user.

USER:<username> - {hash}:
{
    username:   {string},
    pwhash:     {string},
}

A user's character will have their id stored in a set keyed to the user's usrname.
This is to enable modifications that allow a single player to play multiple characters.
The intended game design is for one account to have one character at a time, but this is
being made intentionally flexable.

USER:<username>:CHARACTERS - {set}:
[
    <idstring>
]

CHARACTER:<idstring> - {hash}:
{
    name: {string},
    class: {string},
    race: {string},
    level: {int},
    location: {roomcode}
}
